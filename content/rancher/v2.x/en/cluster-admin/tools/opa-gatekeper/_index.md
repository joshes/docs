_Available as of v2.4.0_

> This is an experimental feature for the Rancher v2.4 release.

To ensure consistency and compliance, every organization needs the ability to define and enforce policies in its environment in an automated way. OPA [https://www.openpolicyagent.org/] (Open Policy Agent) is a policy engine that facilitates policy-based control for cloud native environments. Rancher provides the ability to enable OPA Gatekeeper in Kubernetes clusters, and also installs a couple of built-in policy definitions, which are also called constraint templates. 

OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets you specify policy as code and ability to extend simple APIs to offload policy decision-making.

[OPA Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) is a project that provides integration between OPA and Kubernetes. OPA Gatekeeper provides:

- An extensible, parameterized policy library.
- Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library, also called â€œconstraints."
- Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library, also called "constraint templates."
- Audit functionality.

To read more about OPA, please refer to the [official documentation.](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/)

# How the OPA Gatekeeper Integration Works

Kubernetes provides the ability to extend API server functionality via admission controller webhooks, which are invoked whenever a resource is created, updated or deleted. Gatekeeper is installed as a validating webhook and enforces policies defined by Kubernetes custom resource definitions. In addition to the admission control usage, Gatekeeper provides the capability to audit existing resources in Kubernetes clusters and mark current violations of enabled policies.

OPA Gatekeeper is made availale via Rancher's Helm system chart, and it is installed in a namespace named `gatekeeper-system.`

# Enabling OPA Gatekeeper in a Cluster

> **Prerequisites:** 
> 
> - Only administrators and cluster owners can enable OPA Gatekeeper.
> - The dashboard needs to be enabled using the `dashboard` feature flag. For more information, refer to the [section on enabling experimental features.]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/feature-flags/)

1. Navigate to the cluster's **Dashboard** view.
1. On the left side menu, expand the cluster menu and click on **OPA Gatekeeper.**
1. To install Gatekeeper with the default configuration, click on **Enable Gatekeeper (v0.1.0) with defaults.**
1. To change any default configuration, click on **Customize Gatekeeper yaml configuration.**
      
# Constraint Templates

[Constraint templates](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper#constraint-templates) are Kubernetes custom resources that define the schema and Rego logic of the OPA policy to be applied by Gatekeeper. For more information on the Rego policy language, refer to the [official documentation.](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/)

When OPA Gatekeeper is enabled, Rancher installs some templates by default.

To list the constraint templates installed in the cluster, go to the left side menu under OPA Gatekeeper and click on **Templates.**

For detailed steps on how to create constraints using these default templates, please refer to [this section.](#using-the-default-constraint-templates)

Rancher also provides the ability to create your own constraint templates by importing YAML definitions.
   
# Creating and Configuring Constraints

[Constraints](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper#constraints) are Kubernetes custom resources that define the scope of objects to which a specific constraint template applies to. The complete policy is defined by constraint templates and constraints together.

> **Prerequisites:** OPA Gatekeeper must be enabled in the cluster.

To list the constraints installed, go to the left side menu under OPA Gatekeeper, and click on **Constraints.**

New constraints can be created from a constraint template.

Rancher provides the ability to create a constraint by using a convenient form that lets you input the various constraint fields.

The **Edit as yaml** option is also availble to configure the the constraint's yaml definition.

### Exempting Rancher's System Namespaces from Constraints

When a constraint is created, ensure that it does not apply to any Rancher or Kubernetes system namespaces. If the system namespaces are not excluded, then it is possible to see many resources under them marked as violations of the constraint.

To limit the scope of the constraint only to user namespaces, always specify these namespaces under the **Match** field of the constraint.

Also, the constraint may interfere with other Rancher functionality and deny system workloads from being deployed. To avoid this, exclude all Rancher-specific namespaces from your constraints.
   
# Enforcing Constraints in your Cluster

When the **Enforcement Action** is **Deny,** the constraint is immediately enabled and will deny any requests that violate the policy defined. By default, the enforcement value is **Deny.**

When the **Enforcement Action** is **Dryrun,** then any resources that violate the policy are only recorded under the constraint's status field.

To enforce constraints, create a constraint using the form. In the **Enforcement Action** field, choose **Deny.** 

# Audit and Violations in your Cluster

OPA Gatekeeper runs a periodic audit to check if any existing resource violates any enforced constraint. The audit-interval (default 300s) can be configured while installing Gatekeeper.

On the Gatekeeper page, any violations of the defined constraints are listed.

Also under **Constraints,** the number of violations of the constraint can be found.

The detail view of each constraint lists information about the resource that violated the constraint.

# Disabling Gatekeeper

1. Navigate to the cluster's Dashboard view
1. On the left side menu, expand the cluster menu and click on **OPA Gatekeeper.**
1. Click the **&#8942; > Disable**.

**Result:** Upon disabling OPA Gatekeeper, all constraint templates and constraints will also be deleted.

# Using the Default Constraint Templates

When OPA Gatekeeper is enabled, Rancher installs some templates by default. Currently the following constraint templates are installed:

1. `k8sallowedrepos` - Template that can be used to whitelist registries.
1. `k8srequiredlabels` - Template that can be used to enforce desired labels on specific Kubernetes objects.

This section describes how to use these templates to create constraints for enforcing certain policies on the cluster via the **Dashboard** view.

Currently it is not possible to create a constraint via "Edit as Form" by passing non-scalar parameters, but one can create them by using the **Edit As YAML** option.

The constraint created can be edited using the form.

### Constraint to Whitelist Registries

Suppose you want to apply a policy that restricts creation of any pods in your cluster to use images only from a whitelisted repository. In this case, you would create a constraint from the  `k8sallowedrepos` template.

For example, suppose we want all pods launched in the namespace `test` to use images only from the quay.io registry.

Steps to do that via Rancher's dashboard view are as follows:

> **Prerequisite:** OPA Gatekeeper must be enabled using the cluster's <b>Dashboard</b> view.

1. Navigate to **OPA Gatekeeper > Constraints > Create.**
1. Use the **Edit As YAML** option on the right hand corner of the Create form. Paste the following YAML and click **Create** to add the constraint:

    ```yaml
    type: constraints.gatekeeper.sh.k8sallowedrepos
    spec:
      match:
        excludedNamespaces:
          - cattle-system
          - gatekeeper-system
          - ingress-nginx
          - kube-node-lease
          - kube-public
          - kube-system
          - security-scan
        kinds:
          - apiGroups: [""]
            kinds: ["Pod"]
        namespaces:
          - "test"
        labelSelector:
          matchExpressions: []
        namespaceSelector:
          matchExpressions: []
      parameters:
        repos:
          - "quay.io"
      enforcementAction: deny
    metadata:
      name: test-repo-is-quay-io
      annotations:
        cattle.io/description: whitelist repo quay.io
    ```
    
    The YAML specifies the directive `repos` as defined by the `k8sallowedrepos` template schema.

    This constraint specifies that the image repository "quay.io" should be used by all pod objects in the `test` namespace. Notice that all the system namespaces are by default added to the list of `excludedNamespaces`. You can edit the constraint via the form to change the namespaces and other information.

**Result:** After the above constraint is created, it will be listed under `K8sAllowedRepos` on the **Constraints** page.  Now if you navigate **Back to Rancher** and create a workload under the `test` namespace with any image other than the "quay.io" registry, you will get an error from OPA Gatekeeper.

### Constraint to Enforce Labels

Suppose you want to apply a policy that requires certain set of labels present on Kubernetes resources of a specific kind, then you can create a constraint from the  `k8srequiredlabels` template.

For example, suppose we want all namespaces in the cluster to be labeled with the name of a team.

Steps to do that via Rancher's dashboard view are as follows:

> **Prerequisite:** OPA Gatekeeper must be enabled using the cluster's <b>Dashboard</b> view.

1. Navigate to OPA Gatekeeper > Constraints > Create.
1. Use the **Edit As YAML** option on the right hand corner of the Create form. Paste the following yaml and click **Create** to add the constraint:

    ```yaml
    type: constraints.gatekeeper.sh.k8srequiredlabels
    spec:
      match:
        excludedNamespaces:
          - cattle-system
          - gatekeeper-system
          - ingress-nginx
          - kube-node-lease
          - kube-public
          - kube-system
          - security-scan
        kinds:
          - apiGroups: [""]
            kinds: ["Namespace"]
        labelSelector:
          matchExpressions: []
        namespaceSelector:
          matchExpressions: []
      parameters:
        message: "All namespaces must have a `team` label that points to your team name"
        labels:
          - key: team
            allowedRegex: "^[a-zA-Z]+$"
      enforcementAction: deny
    metadata:
      name: ns-must-have-label
      annotations:
        cattle.io/description: constraint for ns label
    ```
    
    The YAML specifies the directives `message` and `labels` as defined by the `k8srequiredlabels` template schema. This constraint defines that all"namespaces must have a label `team` whose value should match the given "allowedRegex". Notice that all the system namespaces are by default added to list of `excludedNamespaces`.

    You can edit the constraint via the form to change the namespaces and other information.

**Result:** After the above constraint is created, it will be listed under `K8sRequiredLabels` on the **Constraints** page. Now if you navigate **Back to Rancher** and create a new namespace in the cluster without having the label `team`, the create request should be denied.
