This section applies to Rancher installations in which the underlying Kubernetes cluster was created with the Rancher CLI.

We recommend using the backup/restore application to back up Rancher and to restore it from backup.

The Helm chart for the application is available as in Rancher. After you have enabled the application, you will be able to use backup templates for apps such as Rancher, Fleet, and the Enterprise Cluster Manager. Then apps can be restored from Kubernetes custom resources.
